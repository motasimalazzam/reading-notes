# What is a Stack

The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. In other words it used to store `Nodes`.

## Common terminology for a stack is

1. **Push** Nodes or items that are put into the stack are **pushed**.

2. **Pop** Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are **popped**. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

3. **Top** This is the top of the stack.

4. **Peek** When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

5. **IsEmpty** returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Concepts:

* **FILO**: First In Last Out. That means the first item added in the stack will be the last item go out of the collection.

* **LIFO**: Last In First Out. That means the last item added in the stack will be the first item go out of the collection.

* **Stack Visualization**: When **push** (add item) something to stack it becomes the new `top` and when **pop** (remove item) that means remove cuurent `top` and set the next `top` as `top.next`.

* **Push O(1)**: Add a new node to the top of stack. 

* **Pop O(1)**: Remove the node from the top of the stack.

* **Peek O(1)**: When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `top` Node of the stack.

# What is a Queue

## Common terminology for a queue is

1. **Enqueue** Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

2. **Dequeue** Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

3. **Front** This is the front/first Node of the queue.

4. **Rear**  This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

5. **Peek**  When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

6. **IsEmpty** returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

## ## Concepts:

* **FIFO**: First In First Out. That means the first item added in the queue  will be the first item go out of the collection.

* **LILO**: Last In Last Out. That means the last item added in the queue will be the Last item go out of the collection.
