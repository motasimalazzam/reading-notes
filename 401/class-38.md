# Notifications

* Amazon Simple Notification Service is a notification service provided as part of Amazon Web Services.

* SNS acts as a single message bus that can message to a variety of devices and platforms.

SNS uses the publish/subscribe model for push delivery of messages. Recipients subscribe to one or more ‘topics’ within SNS. Typically this is hidden from the user as an internal part of a mobile app. Receipt of a message may also be hidden from the user: this service is largely aimed at the internal processing of specific apps, rather than as a generic email substitute .
