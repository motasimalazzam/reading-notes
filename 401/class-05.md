# Linked Lists

A **linked List** is a linear data structure and The elements in a linked are linked using pointers.

## Types of Linked List:

1. Singly: A node in the singly linked list consist of two parts: data part and link part. Each node contains only next pointer.

2. Doubly: Contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

## Node 

Nodes are the individual items in linked list and each node contains data and property called `Next` which contains the reference to the next node.

## Head
It is the first node in a linked list.

## Traversal

When traversing a linked list we depend on the next value im each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. It is important because it leads us to the next node and aloow us to extract the data appropriately.

## Advantages of Linked List

1. Dynamic Data Structure

2. Insertion and Deletion

3. No memory wastage

4. Implementation

## Disadvantages of Linked List

1. Slow Search Time

2. Slow Traversal

3. Use more memory
