# Packages and Import

The directory in java called **Package** and it is containing the group of classes. the packed name should be the same name as a directory that contains the java files. To use specific classes from another package we must import the package by writing the **import** statements. 

# Loops 

It is the execution of a set of commands a certain number of times specified by a certain condition, and the repetition is stopped when the condition becomes **false**. There are three types of loops in java:

* Simple for loop: We use the foor loop when we know the number of repetitions we want.

* While loop: is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is not fixed

* Do-While loop: is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once
