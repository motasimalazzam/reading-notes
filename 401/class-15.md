# Trees

* A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

## Common Terminology

* **Node**: A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes.

* **Root**: The root is the node at the beginning of the tree.

* **K**: A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

* **Left**: A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.

* **Right**: A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree.

* **Edge**: The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.

* **Leaf**: A leaf is a node that does not have any children.

* **Height**: The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## Binary Tree Data Structure

**Binary Tree Data Structure** has  elements and each elemnt has at most 2 children and each child called left and right child. Each `Node` contains:

1. Data

2. Pointer to left child

3. Pointer to right child

**Traversals**:

* Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node and print out the contents of a tree.

* Tree Traversing ways:

    1. Depth First

    2. Breadth First 

**Depth First**

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the height of the tree first. There are three methods for depth first traversal:

1. Pre-order: `root >> left >> right`

2. In-order: `left >> root >> right`

3. Post-order: `left >> right >> root`
