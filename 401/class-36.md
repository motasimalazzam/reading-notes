```
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
```

3. Last step in terminal is push the changes by `amplify push` command.

4. Now add the following dependency to your app’s **build.gradle**:

```
dependencies {
implementation ‘com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.24.0’
