# Monetization

* Choose a monetization model for your app to maximize your revenue, consider a flexible monetization strategy that adapts to your audiences and markets.

## Sell goods or services through your app

When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments:

1. **Google Play's billing system**:

Use Google Play's billing system to sell digital goods or services within an app on Google Play. Google Play's billing system makes it easy for users to consistently, securely, and seamlessly purchase your goods and services for your app.

Items that require developers to use Google Playâ€™s billing system include the following:

* Virtual game products.

* App functionality or content.

* Subscription services.

* Cloud software products.

2. **Google Pay**:

Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside of your app. Google Pay provides your customers a faster, safer way to pay online, both in apps and wherever contactless payments are accepted.

Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

* Retail merchandise.

* Physical services.

* One-time membership fees or recurring dues.

* Electronic bill payment.
