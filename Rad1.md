Choosing A Text Editor

You must choose the appropriate text editor for the user, according to the features you need and the kind of project you want to do.

A text editor is a software that is loaded on a computer or online, and through it the programming code is written and websites built. There are many features of it:

1) Code completion 2) syntax highlighting

The most important feature is code completion because it helps reduce errors when writing programs and also there is another feature is syntax highlighting because it helps in organizing work.

We do not use the text editor on the computer because it lacks many of the features necessary to complete the work. There are many text editors out there, each with its own special features.

The difference between a text editor and an IDE is that a text editor writes and modifies texts while an IDE is an integrated development environment that contains a text editor and a file manager. So every IDE is a text editor, and not every a text editor is IDE.

 

The command line

A command line or terminal is a textual interface to the system through which we can write and execute commands and through which the outputs appear.

There are many commands that are written on the command line, and one of these commands is (ls), where it is usually written at the beginning to show the list of files and directories, and we complete it by typing (-l / home /{directory name}). Pay attention to the space between the letters and the symbols, because each space and each symbol have a special task in it. And after its implementation, the menu appears. Most of the commands show outputs and some of the commands show no output.

Basic navigation

There are many commands that help us in navigating the system:

1) PWD: When executed, it prints the current location, so it is used frequently from time to time to know where you are.

2) ls: It prints files in the location where it is located, and this command may include symbols that change its function, and this is the general form ( ls [option] [location] ), for example ( ls -l ) where this command shows all the contents of the current location. And, a letter (d) may appear in the output, and this indicates the directories, and a symbol (-) denotes the files.

3) cd: Change Directories or move to another directory and the general form is ( cd [location] ).

Path is the way to get to a specific file or directory, and there are two types:

1) Absolute path: starting with ( / ), the site is determined by the programmer and the output appears based on the location that was entered, regardless of the current location.

2) Relative path : does not start with ( / ), prints results based on the current location only.

We can reduce spelling errors while typing by clicking on the tab button on the keyboard and it will write the command.

More about files

To understand a Linux system, one must know that everything is a file. Linux system differs from Windows by recognizing the type of files, as Windows identifies the type of files through the extension, while the Linux system identifies the file type by knowing its content, regardless of its extension, and there is a command for the programmer that is written to identify the file type, which is ( File [path] ).

Linux is a sensitive system when dealing with file and directory names, so you should pay attention to the character arrangement, the case of the letters, and also the space between the words of a single file or directory name.

When a file name consists of two words with a space between them, the name must be placed in quotation marks ( ‘name’ ) or the separation between the two words by ( \ ) so that the name is considered as one unit.
