Markdown is the way to format text on the web, and it provides many options for formatting such as font formatting, adding images, and displaying files. Mostly, markdown is just text that consists of letters and sometimes contains symbols like (#) or (*).
GitHub contains its own version of Markdown that provides a wide range of features that make it easier to work on GitHub, such as:
1)	Syntax highlighting.
2)	Tables: You can create tables by separating words using - (for the first row) and | For columns.
3)	Username @mentions: After typing the @ symbol, you can call any user to view your project.
4)	Automatic linking for URLs: Any link that is included will be activated and can be click on it.

There are basic symbols [ like ( #) (*) (+) ] that are dealt with, each of which has its own function, and the function also changes by changing the way it is written.

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.
