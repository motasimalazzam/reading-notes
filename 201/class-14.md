# Project Aristotle 

Google has spent a lot of money studying every aspect of its employees, seeking to develop a collaborative work environment among employees and thus increase the company's productivity.

Aristotle's project is a project that aims to find out why one team outperforms and the other stumbles.

This project was studying the formation of the superior and effective group, and what are the criteria for the superiority of one group over another, is the reason for this is that the members of the same team have the same interests? Or are they communicating outside the work environment? Or do they have commonalities such as hobbies?

This project lasted for a long time and it was difficult to find specific criteria for the superiority of one team over the other.

After the project was completed, it was concluded that: research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making teamwork.
