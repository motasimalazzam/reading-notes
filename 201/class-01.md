Attributes are placed with some tags and their task is to modify the tag function and the general form is { name = “ value “ }.

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. We use HTML5 and we write <!DOCTYPE html> in HTML document. To write comments in HTML we can use these characters: <!-- --> and add comments between it.

HTML5 Layout

There are layout elements that help web page designers to build and design pages, and from these elements:

1) <div> : used to group the large section of HTML elements together.

2) <header> : is used as a container of introductory content or navigation links.

3) <footer> : is used to define a footer for a document or a section. It is generally used in the last of the section (bottom of the page).
