# Transforms 

CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. With transform property, we can change size, position and change elements. And it came in two different settings (**2D** and **3D**).

# 2D Transforms

2D Transforms work on the ***X*** and ***Y*** axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 2D Transforms has values we can apply on elements like **2D Rotate**, **2D Cube** and **2D Translate**. I will do a simple explanation of the **2D Rotate**.

## 2D Rotate

This rotates value allows to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees, and with a positive value, the element will rotate clockwise, and counterclockwise with a negative value. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50%, 50%, both horizontally and vertically.

# 3D Transforms

3D Transforms work on three axes, ***X***,***Y*** and ***Z***, which giving us control of depth as well as length and width. Also it have many values as ***2D Trnsforms*** we can apply on elements.

# Transitions and Animations

Withe CSS3 we can write bevaviors for transitions and animation. This helps developers to add their designs to the elements without using ***JavaScript*** or ***Flash***.

# Transitions

By Transitions, we can change the state of the element from one style to another style by using 4 different states which are :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

# Animations

We can add animation effects to elements by determining the points of the movement of the element, and this is called **Animations Keyframes**.
