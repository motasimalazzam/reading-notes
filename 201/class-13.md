# Local storage

The operating system provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like the preferences or runtime state of the local machine.

**Cookies**: Were invented early in the web's history, and they used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data.

Cookies have disadvantages:

1) Cookies are included with every ***HTTP*** request, which that making the web application slowing down.

2) Sending data unencrypted over the internet.

3) They are limited to **4KB** of data.

# Before HTML5

Internet Explorer (which is a Microsoft browser) has DHTML behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called **userData**.

userData allows web pages to store up to **64KB** of data per domain.

In 2002, Adobe invented **Flash cookies** within the Flash environment, and it is allowed to store up **100KB** of data per domain.

In 2007, Google launched **Gears**, which can store unlimited amounts of data per domain.

# HTML5 storage

HTML5 storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally within the client web browser.

From your JavaScript code, youâ€™ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object. Before you can use it, you should detect whether the browser supports it.
