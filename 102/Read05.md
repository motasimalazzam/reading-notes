Comparison operators: Evaluating condition:

1) == {is equal to}: compare the value only.

2) === {strict equal to}: compare the value and the datatype.

3) != {is not equal to}: not equal value only.

4) !== {strict not equal to}: not equal value and the datatype.

5) > : greater than. 

6) < : less than.

7) >= : greater than or equal. 

8) <= : less than or equal.


Logical operators:

It is a comparison of more than one condition at the same time.

1) && {logical and}: tests more than on condition. And the result is true if all conditions are true.

2) || {logical or}: the result is true if at least one condition is true.

3) ! {logical not}: test a single Boolean value and inverts it.

Loops

It is a block of programming commands, it is executed more than once based on the fulfillment of the condition, and it stops working at the first false of the condition, and we have 3 types:

1) For loop: It is used if we want to execute the programming commands a certain number of times, and a counter is used to determine the number of times of execution, and it is the most used. General form:
For(initialization ; condition ; update ){the code}.


2) While loop: We use it when we don't know how many times a loop will repeat, and it stops working at the first false.
General form:  While(the condition){the cod}.


3) Do while loop: Similar to the previous type, but the difference is that it executes the condition one time again for the last time after the first false.
