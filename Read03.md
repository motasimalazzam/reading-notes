7) Wireframes: Draw a diagram showing the shape and contents of the site.

The website must contain parts and each part for a specific purpose, in other words the website is divided into parts (body, head, title).
HTML is used to build the parts of the website by using the  tags  and CSS is used to format the contents of the website.
There are tags that are often used in web design, such as <]> that are putting the information to groups.  HTML5 provides new elements that divide the parts of the page and these elements facilitate the work of the programmer in the structure of the website such as [ <header> , <footer>, <nav> ].
There are many versions of HTML, and each new version contains elements that help create web pages more quickly and efficiently. The latest version must be used because it contains the best features, and when dealing with the browser, the HTML version must be written in the browser like this <!DOCTYPE html>
