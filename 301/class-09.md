# Functional Programming Concepts

1) What is functional programming?

Is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

2) What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)

* It does not cause any observable side effects

3) What are the benefits of a pure function?

They are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments. They also makes maintaining and refactoring code much easier.

4) What is immutability?

Is the idea that data or objects should not be modified after they are created.

5) What is Referential transparency?

An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior.

# Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1) What is a module?

Is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application.

2) What does the word ‘require’ do?

It resolves libraries and modules in the Node search path.

3) How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

We use reqiure(); to import that module.

4) What do we have to do to make a module available?

Use module.export inside the module itself.
