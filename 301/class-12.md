| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS).                                           | primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.|
| have predefined schema.                                                                     | have dynamic schema for unstructured data.                 |
| are vertically scalable.                                                                    | are horizontally scalable.                                 |     
| uses ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data.                  | queries are focused on collection of documents.            |
| are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.                                   | are not good fit for complex queries.                      |
